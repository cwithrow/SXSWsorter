Scrapes a listing of unofficial SXSW shows from Austin Chronicle, such as [this one](https://web.archive.org/web/20180309231541/https://www.austinchronicle.com/sxsw/unofficial/), which lists bands by club by day, and puts it into a json file where every artist performance has a separate record, allowing simple searching in pandas or other tool for artist view, such as below.
